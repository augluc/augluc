### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas Augusto (augluc) from Brazil, and I'm here to share all my progress in learning how to program. I started in 2021 by learning Java. Now I'm working with C# and all technologies and frameworks that envolve, trying to learn as much as I can. I also enjoy frontending technologies, ui, ux, wireframing and design in general.
